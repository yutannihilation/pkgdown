\section{YAML config}{

To tweak the home page, you need a section called \code{home}.

The sidebar links are automatically generated by inspecting the
\code{URL} and \code{BugReports} fields of the \code{DESCRIPTION}.
You can add additional links with a subsection called \code{links},
which should contain a list of \code{text} + \code{href} elements:

\preformatted{
home:
  links:
  - text: Link text
    href: http://website.com
}

The "developers" list is populated by the maintainer ("cre"), authors
("aut"), and funder ("fnd").
